THIS IS NOT OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE

The purpose of publishing this code is to demonstrate a modular approach to a
design of embedded 'C' drivers and application code for an Internet-connected
nodal device.  Not all components of the final build are included here.  The
missing elements are third-party commercial products that have been licensed
for use in the end-product.  Some details of the client implementation have
also been redacted (see placeholders marked with "%%" in code files).
